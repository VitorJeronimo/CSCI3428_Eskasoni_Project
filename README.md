# CSCI3428 - Saint Mary's University: Eskasoni Project
This project is a version of a Mi’kmaw Scattergories game called *Aij...?*, 
developed for the Mi’kmaw community at Eskasoni.

## About *Aij...?*
The project is based on the Scattergories game, which is a competitive game that
requires players to actively recall words, strengthening the connections to
those words.

*Aij...?* is presented 100% in the Mi'kmaw language and it is aimed towards
people from any age group that are trying to learn the language.

Our goal is to encourage students in the Mi'kmaw community to immerse themselves
into the language and spend more time working on their vocabulary, while also having
fun!
